Notable Unity Projects:

Rebuilding Mario from scratch like this taught me a lot about how Unity works for 2D projects, and deepened my understanding of how C# and Unity work together.

This project taught me a great amount about how Unity handles lighting, and how the parent-child system can be used to create relative movements.

Time Attack Game

This game I experimented with inter-object conditions to have the game randomize each time it is loaded.
